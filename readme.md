# üìö Bookish

Bookish is a full-stack Flask web application that helps readers track their books, import data from Goodreads/StoryGraph, and discover new recommendations using the OpenLibrary API.

The app also integrates with external book sources (OpenLibrary, Google Books, Project Gutenberg) to suggest free or affordable deals, and runs background workers to process tasks like recommendations and CSV imports asynchronously.
